# Feature Extraction and Selection

Featuree extraction is a process of transforming raw data into a simplified and more informative representation (self of features or attributes).

- improved performance of machine learning algorithms
- prevent overfitting
- Better insights
- Reduced computational cost

Techniques for feature extraction:
- Statistical Methods: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, correlation coefficients, covariance, regression analysis - Scipy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, LDA
- Feature Extraction for Textual Data: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) - NLTK, SpaCy
- Signal Processing Techniques: Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform
- Image Processing Techniques: Edge Detection, Color Histograms, Texture Analysis, CNN - OpenCV, PIL, TensorFlow, Keras

Few techniques for feature selection:
- Information Loss
- Complexity Reduction
